# Autonomous Database Agents

**Self-Managing ML Infrastructure Through Database-Native Automation**

Agents in DeclarativeML are autonomous database processes that handle system optimization, model lifecycle management, and operational tasks without human intervention. They operate entirely within the database layer using stored procedures, triggers, and scheduled jobs.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Agent Types

**Training Agents**
- Monitor model convergence and performance metrics
- Implement early stopping and regularization strategies  
- Handle hyperparameter optimization and architecture search
- Coordinate distributed training across PostgreSQL instances

**Deployment Agents**
- Manage model versioning and A/B testing
- Handle canary deployments and rollback procedures
- Monitor inference performance and accuracy drift
- Coordinate model updates across serving infrastructure

**Resource Agents**
- Optimize query execution plans for ML workloads
- Manage memory allocation and caching strategies
- Balance load across distributed PostgreSQL instances
- Handle data partitioning and replication

**Monitoring Agents**
- Detect data drift and concept drift in production models
- Track system health and performance metrics
- Generate alerts and notifications for anomalies
- Maintain audit logs and compliance reporting

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through the database-native pub/sub system:

```sql
-- Agent publishes events to coordination layer
PUBLISH EVENT 'model.convergence.detected' 
  WITH PAYLOAD {
    'model_name': 'fraud_detector',
    'final_accuracy': 0.94,
    'training_epochs': 87,
    'convergence_reason': 'validation_plateau'
  };

-- Other agents subscribe to relevant events
SUBSCRIBE TO 'model.convergence.*' 
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE handle_model_ready();
```

## Agent Implementation Patterns

### Convergence Detection Agent

```sql
CREATE AGENT overfitting_monitor AS
BEGIN
  DECLARE model_metrics RECORD;
  DECLARE patience_counter INTEGER := 0;
  DECLARE best_validation_loss DECIMAL := NULL;
  
  -- Check every 10 training epochs
  SCHEDULE EVERY '10 EPOCHS' 
  FOR EACH MODEL IN training_state
  DO
    SELECT validation_loss, training_loss, epoch
    INTO model_metrics
    FROM model_training_log 
    WHERE model_name = CURRENT_MODEL
    ORDER BY epoch DESC LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Detect overfitting patterns
    IF best_validation_loss IS NULL OR 
       model_metrics.validation_loss < best_validation_loss THEN
      best_validation_loss := model_metrics.validation_loss;
      patience_counter := 0;
    ELSE
      patience_counter := patience_counter + 1;
    END IF;
    
    -- Stop training if overfitting detected
    IF patience_counter >= 3 THEN
      PUBLISH EVENT 'training.early_stop'
        WITH PAYLOAD {
          'model_name': CURRENT_MODEL,
          'reason': 'overfitting_detected',
          'best_epoch': epoch - (patience_counter * 10)
        };
      
      EXECUTE stop_training(CURRENT_MODEL);
      EXECUTE rollback_to_checkpoint(CURRENT_MODEL, best_validation_loss);
    END IF;
  END FOR;
END;
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization Agent

```sql
CREATE AGENT hyperparameter_optimizer AS
BEGIN
  DECLARE search_space JSONB;
  DECLARE current_trial RECORD;
  DECLARE trial_results RECORD[];
  
  -- Initialize Bayesian optimization search space
  SET search_space = '{
    "learning_rate": {"type": "log_uniform", "low": 0.0001, "high": 0.1},
    "batch_size": {"type": "choice", "values": [32, 64, 128, 256]},
    "dropout_rate": {"type": "uniform", "low": 0.1, "high": 0.5}
  }';
  
  -- Run optimization trials
  FOR trial_id IN 1..50 LOOP
    -- Sample new hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization
    SELECT sample_hyperparameters(search_space, trial_results)
    INTO current_trial;
    
    -- Launch training with sampled parameters
    PUBLISH EVENT 'training.start'
      WITH PAYLOAD {
        'model_name': CURRENT_MODEL || '_trial_' || trial_id,
        'hyperparameters': current_trial.params,
        'parent_optimization': CURRENT_OPTIMIZATION_ID
      };
    
    -- Wait for training completion
    WAIT FOR EVENT 'training.complete'
      WHERE payload->>'parent_optimization' = CURRENT_OPTIMIZATION_ID;
    
    -- Record trial results
    trial_results := array_append(trial_results, current_trial);
  END LOOP;
  
  -- Select best configuration and deploy
  SELECT best_hyperparameters(trial_results) INTO current_trial;
  PUBLISH EVENT 'optimization.complete'
    WITH PAYLOAD current_trial.params;
END;
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Event-Driven Workflows

Agents coordinate through event chains without direct coupling:

```sql
-- Training completion triggers multiple downstream agents
ON EVENT 'training.complete' 
  EXECUTE validation_agent.evaluate_model();
  
ON EVENT 'validation.passed'
  EXECUTE deployment_agent.stage_model();
  
ON EVENT 'model.staged'
  EXECUTE monitoring_agent.setup_drift_detection();
  EXECUTE notification_agent.alert_stakeholders();
```

### State Synchronization

Agents maintain shared state through database tables with event notifications:

```sql
-- Agents update shared state atomically
UPDATE agent_coordination_state 
SET current_best_model = 'fraud_detector_v3',
    last_update_timestamp = NOW(),
    update_agent = 'hyperparameter_optimizer'
WHERE optimization_id = CURRENT_OPTIMIZATION_ID;

-- Notify other agents of state changes
PUBLISH EVENT 'coordination.state_updated'
  WITH PAYLOAD {
    'optimization_id': CURRENT_OPTIMIZATION_ID,
    'new_best_model': 'fraud_detector_v3',
    'updated_by': 'hyperparameter_optimizer'
  };
```

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Agent Registration

```sql
-- Register new agent with the system
REGISTER AGENT overfitting_monitor
  WITH CAPABILITIES ['training_monitoring', 'early_stopping']
  SUBSCRIBE TO ['training.epoch_complete', 'model.training_started']
  PUBLISH TO ['training.early_stop', 'training.checkpoint_created']
  PRIORITY 'high'
  RESOURCE_LIMITS {'max_memory': '1GB', 'max_cpu': '2 cores'};
```

### Agent Health Monitoring

```sql
-- System agent monitors other agents
CREATE AGENT agent_health_monitor AS
BEGIN
  FOR EACH registered_agent IN active_agents LOOP
    IF last_heartbeat(registered_agent) > INTERVAL '5 minutes' THEN
      PUBLISH EVENT 'agent.health.failure'
        WITH PAYLOAD {
          'failed_agent': registered_agent,
          'last_seen': last_heartbeat(registered_agent)
        };
      
      EXECUTE restart_agent(registered_agent);
    END IF;
  END LOOP;
END;
```

## Development Philosophy

Agents embody the "database-native everything" principle by:

1. **Operating entirely within database transactions** for consistency and reliability
2. **Using stored procedures and triggers** instead of external services
3. **Communicating through database pub/sub** rather than network protocols  
4. **Storing all state in database tables** with proper ACID guarantees
5. **Leveraging database scheduling** instead of external cron jobs

This approach ensures that agent behavior is auditable, recoverable, and integrates seamlessly with the ML workflow execution engine.

## Future Enhancements

- **Agent Learning**: Agents that improve their strategies based on historical performance
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Complex workflows requiring cooperation between multiple agent types
- **Agent Marketplaces**: Pluggable agents for specialized ML domains (NLP, computer vision, etc.)
- **Cross-Instance Agents**: Agents that coordinate across the distributed PostgreSQL instances
